# Yo Code - Extension and Customization Generator
[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-generator-code.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-generator-code)

We have written a Yeoman generator to help get you started. We plan to add templates for most extension/customization types into this.

## Install the Generator

Install Yeoman and the VS Code Extension generator:

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-code
```

## Run Yo Code
The Yeoman generator will walk you through the steps required to create your customization or extension prompting for the required information.

To launch the generator simply type:

```bash
yo code
```
